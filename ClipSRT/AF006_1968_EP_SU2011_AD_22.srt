is not from Texas about yourself, your family

2

No, but uhm...El Paso is a really nice place

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to come and visit, to stay, to live. The weather's
great, it's very hot, pero it’s better than

having tornados and tsunamis and all of that.

have enchiladas, tacos, you know. I think

El Paso is very Mexican. So it's a great place
to, to live.

chiles rellenos, no más que, I don't know
