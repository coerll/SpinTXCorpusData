>>i:  ¡ Qué bien! What would you want to
tell someone who is not from Texas about yourself,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
your family or your community?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
>>s: Okay, ehm ... I guess in that case I would tell
them that we live in a special place, that

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I am very fortunate to live here because I have
traditions from two different places, that

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
uhm ... it 's a very unique place compared to other places
in the U . S .  That uhm ... there is a lot

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
of traditions that are not gonna be in another
place, that they are gonna find friendly people,

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that they 're gonna be welcome here, that uhm ... somehow
we live in our own little world but it 's very

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
nice and just overall that is a mixture of
two traditions, but uhm ... that are all very

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
friendly, educated, nice people ... live here .
