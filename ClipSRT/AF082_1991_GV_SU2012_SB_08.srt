00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
>> i: Wow. Okay. ¿Y te mudarías a otro estado
en Estados Unidos? ¿A California?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
>> s: California, sí.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
>> i: ¿A Chicago?

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
>> s: No. Ya para allá, no.

5
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
>> i: ¿No?

6
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
>> s: No. I've ... es que no ...

7
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
>> i: ¿A Florida?

8
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
>> s: A Florida, sí. I think more, like,
over there, like, on the East Coast would

9
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
be too much of a drastic change for me because,
I mean, there's no Mexican people over there.

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I feel so out of place.

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
>> i: ¿O no tantos?

12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
>> s: Pues, sí. Yeah. Yeah, there's not a
lot over there, and I'm ... I'm kind of, like,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
you know, 'What if they're mean to me and
stuff?' I think that [inaudible].

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
>> i: Yeah. ¿Y has experimentado una vez
una discriminación?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
>> s: No. Pero mirada, sí...mirada, sí.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
>> i: ¿Cómo qué? ¿Cómo te sientes?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
>> s: Like... I don't know. Like, it's weird.
Like, you know, like, they just look at you,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
like ... like, 'Oh.' Like, 'Ugh.' I'm just,
like, What ... 'What am I doing?' Yeah. But,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I mean, it's a little sad, I guess, I would
say. But that's it.
