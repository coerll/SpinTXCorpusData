ClipPedagogicalMetadata
=======================

This folder contains *.out, *.pla, and *tsv files:

- *.out files are the transcripts with the linguistic and pedagogical annotations in CG3 format
- *.pla files are files with Plain List of Annotations that give human readable list of the annotations in a given transcript file
- *.tsv files are Tab Separated Value files mostly containing pedagogical annotation information in a format compatible with SpinTX website to feed the DRUPAL/Solr search engine/indexation
  NOTE: the only important *.tsv file is ClipMetadataPedagogical.tsv (the rest are intermediate files that I need to create this one, I know it's kinda dirty, but this is how it is right now)
