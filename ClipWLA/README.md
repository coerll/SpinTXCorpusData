ClipWLA
=======

This folder (WLA stands for word level annotations) contains *json files that contain the transcripts with the linguistic and pedagogical annotations in JSON format, compatible with the SpinTX website highlighting and hiding functionalities.

It also contains the files TokenTagsPedagogical.tsv and TokenTagsPedagogical.json which contain the same information but in one single file (for practical purposes during upgrades of the SpinTX site).
